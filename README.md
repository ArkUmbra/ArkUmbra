### Greetings. I'm Luke.
I'm an engineer currently living in Tokyo, Japan.

Professionally, I've spent most of my career as a Java engineer in and around financial services, but here on GitHub I like to spend my time on personal projects and trying out new ideas.


### More of me
Here are some links to places I live around the internet. You're more than welcome to drop me a message there.
